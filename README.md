# Steem
This is the code that gets past rolling data for MagicDice, a dice rolling app on Steem Blockchain, does some comuptations and decides to bet. The results of the bet are then used to bet further with increased betvalue or decreased betvalue. I have run it for a month to test. It does generate profits but at times get trapped. Sharing it here for community to take it up develop it further.
